Q2. If it is at the end of a method a '?' will usually returen a boolean value and '!' will mean the method is distructive.
    1) '!=' is basically 'not equal', you are asking if the return is opposite of the argument
    2) '!' before something turns it into the opposite of its boolean
    3) '!' after a method usually means it is distructive
    4) '?' can be used befor ':' as an if ternary operator
    5) '?' after something usually means the method is boolean
    6) '!!' before something turns an object into its boolean equivalent
